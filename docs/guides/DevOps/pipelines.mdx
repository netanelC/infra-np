### Bundler pipeline

The [bundler pipeline](https://jenkins.mapcolonies.net/job/bundler/) has 1 parameter which is the `artifacts.json` file.

Here's an example of the `artifacts.json` 


```json
{
  "docker": {
    "acrarolibotnonprod.azurecr.io": {
      "3d-gateway": "v2.4.2",
      "store-trigger": "v1.5.2"
    },
    "docker.io": {
      "bitnami/redis": "7.2.3",
      "timonwong/uwsgi-exporter": "latest"
    }
  },
  "helm": {
    "acrarolibotnonprod.azurecr.io": {
      "gateway": "2.4.2",
      "store-trigger": "1.5.2"
    },
    "https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami": {
      "redis": "18.5.0"
    }
  },
  "git": [
    "MapColonies/helm-charts"
  ]
}
```  

In order to trigger the [bundler pipeline](https://jenkins.mapcolonies.net/job/bundler/) you'll need to follow the steps below:  

* Go to the bundler pipeline
* Click on `Build with parameters`

* After the bundler will finish it'll send a slack message to the `<team>-notifications` channel based on the user logged in.

* Click on the download link in the slack message and download the bundle zip file which you'll use later on in the unbundler in the relevant network.

* Click on `Choose file` and select the bundler zip file from your computer
![Unbundler browse file](./img/unbundler-browse-file-1.png)
