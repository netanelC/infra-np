Config Management is the complete solution to manage all the configuration needs of MapColonies.
It's intended to support the system in all stages from early development to production.


Config management has the following parts:

- [schemas](https://github.com/MapColonies/schemas) - Contains the JSON Schemas that define all the configs
- [config-server](https://github.com/MapColonies/config-server) - Server for managing all the configurations
- [config](https://github.com/MapColonies/config) - NPM package for using config management with your NodeJS service
- [config-ui](https://github.com/MapColonies/config-ui) - UI for interacting with the config server

## Motivation
The MapColoniesâ„¢ Config Management system provides a centralized solution for managing all service configurations. 
This system ensures a single source of truth, simplifying configuration management. 
It also validates configurations against a JSON Schema, guaranteeing their correctness. 
Additionally, schema validation ensures that all configurations are strongly typed, enabling seamless integration with your code.

This system will also helps you handle config changes easier. If any of the config has changed, 
instead of changing the env and redeploy all the deployment, 
you can just rollout the pod in order to get the new config.

Now you can see the [zero to hero doc](/docs/guides/config-management/zero-to-hero.mdx) and integrate this system in your service!

## What's Next

- **Customizable Configuration for Testing**: We'll add the ability to customize configurations specifically for testing purposes.
- **Enhanced Observability**: We'll add improved observability features to facilitate more detailed analysis.
- **UI Improvements**: We'll refine the user interface to enhance interaction and usability.
